# Sales Data Dashboard in Excel

## Project Overview

This project focuses on an Excel-based Sales Data Dashboard that helps analyze and visualize sales trends over multiple years. The dataset provided includes sales information for three key product categories: **Furniture**, **Technology**, and **Office Supplies**. The dashboard provides insights into profit changes across different years, identifies top-performing customers, and analyzes sales performance by product categories. The main goal is to give a clear understanding of sales performance, customer contributions, and category-wise sales distribution.

## Project Objectives

The primary objectives of this project are:
- **Track Profit Changes Over the Years**: Understand how profits have evolved year by year.
- **Identify Key Customers**: Recognize which customers contribute most to the company's profits.
- **Analyze Sales by Product Categories**: Break down sales by category (Furniture, Technology, Office Supplies) and find out which category is performing the best.
- **Top-Selling Products**: Identify the highest-selling products in each category.
- **Sales Comparison**: Compare the sales across different categories to understand the sales distribution and performance differences.

## Data Analysis Questions

The project aims to answer the following key questions:
1. How have profits changed over the years for each product category?
2. Which customers have contributed the most to the profits of the company?
3. Which product category has the highest total sales?
4. What is the sales distribution across different categories (Furniture, Technology, Office Supplies)?
5. Who are the top customers in each category, and what is their contribution?
6. Which product or category consistently outperforms the others in terms of sales?

## Methodology

### Data Cleaning

Before performing any analysis, the data was cleaned to ensure accuracy and consistency. The following steps were taken during the cleaning process:
- Removed any duplicate entries that might skew the analysis.
- Corrected any discrepancies in the product or customer names.
- Ensured that all sales data was in the correct format (numeric values for sales, dates in consistent format).

### Data Processing

After cleaning, the data was processed to ensure it was ready for analysis:
- Applied filters to view data by specific years, product categories, and customer groups.
- Used pivot tables to aggregate the data for easier comparison between years and product categories.
- Calculated year-on-year growth in profits and sales for each product category and customer.

### Data Analysis

Once the data was processed, several key analyses were performed:
- **Yearly Profit Analysis**: A year-over-year comparison was done to observe how profits have changed.
- **Customer Contribution Analysis**: We identified the top customers contributing the most to the profits.
- **Category-Wise Sales Breakdown**: We analyzed the sales in each category and compared them to identify the highest-performing category.
- **Top Products**: We identified the best-selling products in each category, based on total sales.
- **Sales Distribution**: We compared the total sales in each category and determined which category had the highest overall sales.

## Tools Used

The following tools and technologies were used in this project:
- **Microsoft Excel**: Used for data analysis, visualization (charts, pivot tables), and dashboard creation.
- **Excel Formulas**: SUM, AVERAGE, VLOOKUP, and IF statements to perform key calculations and analysis.
- **Pivot Tables**: For summarizing large datasets and comparing sales data over multiple years.
